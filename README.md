If you're here visitng but aren't one of my friends, welcome to my spaghetti code RPG Bot!

RPG TO DO LIST
==============
~~Redo Monster array to either pull from the DB or a JSON (haven't decided yet, probably latter).~~
~~Add experience/credit gain after monster death. Credit loss after player death.~~
~~Fix player/monster damage equation. Keeps doing more damage in print than it should.~~
~~Healing is especially forked up. Keeps healing for more than it even says it does on print.~~
~~Leveling isn't triggering when xp equals the new level. Might need a new DB pull.~~
~~Shop systems.~~
~~Better formatting for combat, bars or lines or something~~
~~Change "shield" icon to "run" icon and revamp run system.~~
* Allow users to pick a name at registration and change name after the fact.
* Improved Leveling Systems (maybe add a base damage/heal/DR/run to each level that gets added in the equation?)
* More robust Weapon, Armor, and Medication systems (maybe class-based, uses markdown tables).
* Class systems (including different Special Moves)
* Add individual combat messages for weapons.
* Add more minigames
* Add auto-combat

KINGDOM BUILDER TO DO LIST
==========================
* Build basic resource management engine
* Build timer system for AFK resource building
* Special Events that trigger under the right circumstances, maybe give rare items
