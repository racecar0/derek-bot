TO DO LIST
==========

* Redo Monster array to either pull from the DB or a JSON (haven't decided yet, probably latter).
* Fix player/monster damage equation. Keeps doing more than it should.
* Allow users to pick a name at registration and change name after the fact.
* Change shield to run.
* Add experience/credit gain after monster death. Credit loss after player death.
* Improved Leveling Systems
* Shop systems.
* More robust Weapon, Armor, and Medication systems.
* Class systems (including different Special Moves)
