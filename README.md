If you're here visitng but aren't one of my friends, welcome to my spaghetti code RPG Bot!

TO DO LIST
==========
~~Redo Monster array to either pull from the DB or a JSON (haven't decided yet, probably latter).~~
~~Add experience/credit gain after monster death. Credit loss after player death.~~
~~Fix player/monster damage equation. Keeps doing more damage in print than it should.~~
~~Healing is especially forked up. Keeps healing for more than it even says it does on print.~~
* Better formatting for combat, bars or lines or something
* Leveling isn't triggering when xp equals the new level. Might need a new DB pull.
* Allow users to pick a name at registration and change name after the fact.
* Change "shield" icon to "run" icon and revamp run system.
* Improved Leveling Systems (maybe add a base damage/heal/DR/run to each level that gets added in the equation?)
* Shop systems.
* More robust Weapon, Armor, and Medication systems (maybe class-based, uses markdown tables).
* Class systems (including different Special Moves)
* Add more minigames
